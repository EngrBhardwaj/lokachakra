## 🚩 Problem Statement

Imagine a big playground where lots of kids want to build amazing things together — robots, games, art, you name it. But here's the problem:

- Some kids are locked out of the playground because they don't have the "right" badge.  
- Others are inside but can't find teammates to play or build with.  
- Some kids have great ideas, but no one listens to them.  
- There are helpers and teachers, but nobody knows they're even there.  
- And there are rule books that make it hard to share toys or tools fairly.  

In real life, this playground is the world of innovation — the space where people try to solve problems, invent cool stuff, and make life better. But today, this space has big problems:

- **Founders** (people with ideas) are alone.  
- **Researchers** can't turn their knowledge into useful tools.  
- **Investors** (those with money) are confused by too many noisy pitches.  
- **Mentors and experts** are not seen or used well.  
- **Legal issues** make it hard to work together across countries.  

All of this happens because everything is controlled by big companies and closed systems. If you're not already inside the circle, it's hard to get in. That means many brilliant people around the world never get a chance.

Lokachakra wants to change that.

## 🖥️ Interactive App Prototype

Below is a minimal React/Tailwind demo showing how users can be matched automatically and collaborate in real time. This uses Socket.io for WebSockets; replace the URL with your backend.

```jsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import io from 'socket.io-client';

// Connect to your Socket.io server
const socket = io('https://your-lokachakra-server.com');

export default function InteractiveApp() {
  const [userId, setUserId] = useState(null);
  const [match, setMatch] = useState(null);
  const [ideas, setIdeas] = useState([]);
  const [input, setInput] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    // On connect, server assigns an ID
    socket.on('connect', () => {
      setUserId(socket.id);
      socket.emit('joinQueue'); // request automatic matching
    });

    // Receive matched partner
    socket.on('matched', (partnerId) => {
      setMatch(partnerId);
    });

    // Receive updated ideas list
    socket.on('ideasUpdate', (allIdeas) => {
      setIdeas(allIdeas);
    });

    return () => socket.disconnect();
  }, []);

  const sendIdea = () => {
    if (!input.trim()) return;
    socket.emit('newIdea', { userId, text: input });
    setInput('');
  };

  return (
    <div className="p-6 max-w-xl mx-auto">
      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Lokachakra Interactive Demo</h2>
      <p className="mb-2">Your ID: {userId}</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Matched with: {match || '…waiting for partner'}</p>

      <div className="mb-4">
        <input
          className="border p-2 w-full"
          placeholder="Share your idea..."
          value={input}
          onChange={(e) => setInput(e.target.value)}
        />
        <button
          className="mt-2 px-4 py-2 bg-blue-600 text-white rounded"
          onClick={sendIdea}
        >
          Add Idea
        </button>
      </div>

      <ul className="space-y-2">
        {ideas.map((idea, i) => (
          <li key={i} className="p-2 border rounded">
            <strong>{idea.userId === userId ? 'You' : idea.userId}:</strong> {idea.text}
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
